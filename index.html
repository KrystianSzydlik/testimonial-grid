            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I
            learned were current, if not more so, in the company I
            joined. I honestly feel i got every penny's worth.

            "I was EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp.
            i've been looking to make a transition and have heard some
            people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
            free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
            shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and
            most gruealing - time of my life. Since completing the
            course i've successfully switched career, working as a
            Software Engineer at a VR startup. "

            Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp
            themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from
            their experiences was easy.

            "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of
            code. I needed some structure from professionals who can
            help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged
            to enroll by a former student of theirs wo can only say
            wonderfull things about the program. The entire curriculum
            and staff did not disappoint. They were very hand-on and i
            never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
            project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
            learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could
            ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during
            interviews as an example of my development experience. It
            certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack-developer
            after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "
